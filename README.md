# Predicting Fraud Suspects at Enron

### The Purpose: Predicting POI

The goal of this project is to use machine learning techniques to create a method of predicting persons of interest. We have data records for 146 different individuals employed at Enron. Information about the financial and communication activity of these individuals during their time at Enron my show correlations to whether or not they committed fraud. Machine learning algorithms can help to find these underlying correlations and use them to predict which individuals committed fraud by building models. 

I think that this dataset was too small to create an incredibly powerful model that can predict a POI, but I was able to discover important trends and attributes within the dataset. I learned that salary, stock options, expenses, and bonuses were all related to POI identification. This is not necessarily suprising because a POI would be likely to have power and influence within Enron. POI may also have trends in their emailing habits, but this may be better determined using a larger dataset.


### The Enron Dataset

The features in the data fall into three main types: financial features, email features and POI labels. They are explained using the descriptions included in the original FindLaw dataset PDF document.

There were three different 'persons of interest' hand-generated for this dataset:
1. Those indicted
2. Those who settled without admitting guilt
3. Those who testified in exchange for immunity
